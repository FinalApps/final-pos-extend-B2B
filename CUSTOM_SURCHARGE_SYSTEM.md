# Custom Surcharge System - Complete Implementation

## âœ… **What We've Built**

### **1. Dedicated Surcharge Input Fields**
Instead of reusing the "Adjust Quantity" button for surcharges, we've created **dedicated input fields**:

```typescript
// State management for surcharge
const [customSurcharge, setCustomSurcharge] = useState('0.00')
const [surchargeDescription, setSurchargeDescription] = useState('')

// Surcharge calculation
const surchargeAmount = useMemo(() => {
  return parseFloat(customSurcharge) || 0
}, [customSurcharge])

// Total fees (delivery + surcharge)
const totalFees = useMemo(() => {
  return deliveryFee + surchargeAmount
}, [deliveryFee, surchargeAmount])
```

### **2. Clean UI Implementation**
**Delivery Screen** now includes:
- **Custom Surcharge ($)** - Number input for surcharge amount
- **Surcharge Description (Optional)** - Text input for surcharge description
- **Clear separation** from delivery fees
- **Real-time updates** when surcharge changes

### **3. Reactive Tax Integration**
The surcharge system is **fully integrated** with our reactive tax calculation:

```typescript
// Tax hook now includes surcharge in calculations
const { taxData, taxAmount, shippingTaxAmount, finalTotal, subtotal } = useTaxCalculation(
  cartItems,
  b2bPricing,
  selectedLocation,
  storeTaxSettings,
  customerTaxExempt,
  totalFees // Now includes delivery + surcharge
)
```

### **4. Comprehensive Order Summary**
**Order Summary** now shows:
- **Subtotal** (products only)
- **Delivery Fee** (if applicable)
- **Custom Surcharge** (if applicable)
- **Surcharge Description** (if provided)
- **Total Fees** (delivery + surcharge)
- **Tax** (calculated on total fees)
- **Final Total** (subtotal + fees + tax)

### **5. Draft Order Integration**
**Draft orders** now include surcharge as **separate line items**:

```typescript
// Add custom surcharge as a line item if applicable
if (surchargeAmount > 0) {
  lineItems.push({
    title: surchargeDescription || 'Custom Surcharge',
    originalUnitPrice: surchargeAmount.toString(),
    quantity: 1,
    customAttributes: [
      { key: "Type", value: "Custom Surcharge" },
      { key: "Description", value: surchargeDescription || "Additional fee" },
      { key: "Taxable", value: taxData?.shippingTaxable ? "Yes" : "No" }
    ]
  })
}
```

### **6. Type Safety**
**B2BOrder interface** updated to include surcharge fields:

```typescript
export interface B2BOrder {
  // ... existing fields
  deliveryFee?: number
  surcharge?: number
  surchargeDescription?: string
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits**

### **Accuracy**
- **No confusion** with product quantity buttons
- **Clear separation** between delivery fees and surcharges
- **Accurate tax calculation** on total fees

### **Transparency**
- **Detailed line items** in draft orders
- **Clear descriptions** for accounting purposes
- **Tax status indicators** for compliance

### **User Experience**
- **Dedicated input fields** for surcharges
- **Real-time updates** when surcharge changes
- **Clear order summary** with surcharge breakdown

### **Maintainability**
- **Type-safe implementation** with TypeScript
- **Clean separation of concerns**
- **Reactive tax integration**

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**

### **1. Surcharge Input**
```
User enters surcharge amount â†’ surchargeAmount updates â†’ totalFees updates â†’ tax hook recalculates
```

### **2. Tax Calculation**
```
totalFees = deliveryFee + surchargeAmount
Tax hook calculates tax on totalFees
Shipping tax applies to totalFees (if taxable)
```

### **3. Order Summary**
```
Subtotal: $100.00
Delivery Fee: $25.00
Custom Surcharge: $15.00 (Rush order fee)
Total Fees: $40.00
Tax (8.75%): $12.25
Total: $152.25
```

### **4. Draft Order Line Items**
```
1. Product A - $50.00
2. Product B - $50.00
3. Standard Delivery - $25.00
4. Custom Surcharge - $15.00
5. CA Sales Tax (8.75%) - $12.25
```

## ðŸ“Š **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Rush Order**
```
Surcharge: $25.00
Description: "Rush order fee"
Result: Added as separate line item with description
```

### **Scenario 2: Special Handling**
```
Surcharge: $50.00
Description: "White-glove delivery"
Result: Added as separate line item with handling details
```

### **Scenario 3: No Surcharge**
```
Surcharge: $0.00
Description: ""
Result: No surcharge line item added
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **State Management**
```typescript
const [customSurcharge, setCustomSurcharge] = useState('0.00')
const [surchargeDescription, setSurchargeDescription] = useState('')
```

### **Reactive Calculations**
```typescript
const surchargeAmount = useMemo(() => parseFloat(customSurcharge) || 0, [customSurcharge])
const totalFees = useMemo(() => deliveryFee + surchargeAmount, [deliveryFee, surchargeAmount])
```

### **Tax Integration**
```typescript
const { taxData, taxAmount, shippingTaxAmount, finalTotal, subtotal } = useTaxCalculation(
  cartItems, b2bPricing, selectedLocation, storeTaxSettings, customerTaxExempt, totalFees
)
```

### **Draft Order Creation**
```typescript
// Surcharge line item
if (surchargeAmount > 0) {
  lineItems.push({
    title: surchargeDescription || 'Custom Surcharge',
    originalUnitPrice: surchargeAmount.toString(),
    quantity: 1,
    customAttributes: [
      { key: "Type", value: "Custom Surcharge" },
      { key: "Description", value: surchargeDescription || "Additional fee" },
      { key: "Taxable", value: taxData?.shippingTaxable ? "Yes" : "No" }
    ]
  })
}
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result**

Your B2B POS extension now has:
- **Dedicated surcharge input fields** (not quantity buttons)
- **Real-time tax calculation** on total fees
- **Transparent order summary** with surcharge breakdown
- **Detailed draft order line items** for accounting
- **Type-safe implementation** with proper interfaces
- **Clean, maintainable code** with reactive updates

The surcharge system is now **production-ready** and **fully integrated** with your reactive tax calculation system! ðŸš€
